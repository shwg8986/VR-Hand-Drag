# VR-Hand-Drag
The VR environment made by Unity. 

This is a VR environment I created myself using Unity Software.
I created interactions that allows the user to drag objects using hand tracking (gesture control) and Ray, which can be used with Oculus Quest2.
I also added a process to acquire the time from first grasping the object to releasing it, and to acquire the coordinates of the object and output them as a CSV file.
